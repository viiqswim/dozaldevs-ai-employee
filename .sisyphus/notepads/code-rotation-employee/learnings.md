# Learnings — code-rotation-employee

## [2026-05-13] Session Start

### Domain Model (CRITICAL)

- Property = Room (not a whole house)
- Locks are SHARED across properties — one physical lock, multiple named passcodes
- Passcode naming: `permanent-visitor-{type}[-{roomNumber}]`
  - HOME → `permanent-visitor-home`
  - ROOM → `permanent-visitor-room-N` (N = last numeric segment of property_name)
  - BUNDLE/MULTI_HOME → `permanent-visitor-bundle`
  - Custom override: `passcode_name` field on property_locks row (check first!)

### Shell Tool Conventions

- All tools: `parseArgs()` → `--help` → arg validation → env var validation → work → JSON stdout
- Errors to stderr, non-zero exit on failure
- No external npm deps — pure TypeScript
- Sifely API quirk: HTTP 200 on auth failure — MUST check `body.code`, not HTTP status
- List success omits `code` field entirely — presence of `code` = error

### Rotation Workflow (user-approved)

1. Generate memorable code (mirror/rhythm, 4-6 digits)
2. Update Hostfully door_code FIRST (before touching locks)
3. For each lock: UPDATE existing passcode in-place (not delete+recreate)
4. If no matching passcode exists (first-time): CREATE it
5. On shared locks: only touch passcode matching expected name

### Test Restriction (CRITICAL)

- ONLY test on: Hostfully UID `c960c8d2-9a51-49d8-bb48-355a7bfbe7e2`
- ONLY test on: Sifely lock `5306-kin-Home Front (PERSONAL)` (lockId: 24572672)
- Do NOT touch any other property or lock until fully verified

### Key Files

- Source of truth for code gen: `/Users/victordozal/repos/real-estate/vlre-hub/apps/api/src/code-rotation/utils/code-generator.util.ts`
- Shell tool pattern: `src/worker-tools/locks/hostfully-door-code.ts`
- Existing Sifely tool: `src/worker-tools/locks/sifely-client.ts`
- Passcode name derivation already ported: `src/worker-tools/locks/diagnose-access.ts` lines 138–164
- Hostfully custom data: GET `/api/v3.2/custom-data?propertyUid={uid}` → find door_code field uid → PUT `/api/v3.2/custom-data/{entryUid}` with `{"text": "<code>"}`
- Approved model: `minimax/minimax-m2.7` only (CRITICAL — never use claude-sonnet/opus/gpt-4o)

## [2026-05-13] generate-code unit tests

### Direct Import Pattern

- `generate-code.ts` calls `main()` at module level (shell tool convention)
- When imported in vitest, `main()` runs synchronously (no awaits), writes one JSON line to stdout — harmless, vitest captures it
- Import with `.js` extension per project's NodeNext convention: `from '../../src/worker-tools/locks/generate-code.js'`
- All 7 pure functions (`generateMemorableCode`, `generateMemorableCodeWithMeta`, `isWeakCode`, `isValidCode`, `describeCode`) importable directly — no mocking needed

### Test Strategy

- Statistical property tests (N=50–200 iterations) work reliably for pattern existence — probability of false negative is negligible (~10^-15)
- Pattern consistency validated by checking ALL generated codes satisfy the union of valid patterns (ABBA || ABAB), not just sampling
- `generateMemorableCodeWithMeta` enables white-box pattern verification: assert code structure matches the reported pattern family
- `maxAttempts: 0` reliably forces the throw path without needing to exhaust the code space
- Invalid length at runtime (`3 as unknown as CodeLength`) causes TypeError from `GENERATORS[3]` being undefined — deterministic throw
- Test location: `tests/worker-tools/generate-code.test.ts` (not in `locks/` subdir per task spec)

### Result

- 40 tests, all pass, 11ms runtime

## [2026-05-13] update-door-code unit tests

### Testing CLI Tools With No Exports via vi.stubGlobal + Dynamic Import

- `update-door-code.ts` is pure CLI (no exports, `main()` called at module load). Direct function imports not possible.
- Strategy: `vi.resetModules()` + `vi.stubGlobal('fetch', vi.fn())` + `await import(TOOL_PATH)` — re-executes the module fresh per test.
- Run tests with `pnpm exec vitest run <path>` (not `pnpm test -- --run <path>`) to avoid the full suite running via `singleFork: true`.

### process.exit Cascade Pattern (Critical)

- `process.exit` fires TWICE per error path: once inside `main()`, then again from the `.catch()` handler.
- Mock: first call captures code + throws `ExitError` to halt execution; second call must be a no-op (return `undefined as never`) to prevent re-throw into an unhandled promise rejection.
- The `.catch()` handler writes `"Fatal: Error: ExitError:N"` to stderr — filter it in `getStderr()` helper with `.filter(c => !c.startsWith('Fatal: Error: ExitError:'))`.

### Timing: setTimeout(0) Flushes Microtask Chains

- For synchronous error paths (exit before first `await`): by the time `await import()` resumes, the `.catch()` microtask has already run. No flush needed, but harmless.
- For async success paths (two `await fetch()` calls in `main()`): `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0))` is needed. Timer fires after all microtasks, so both fetch awaits complete before the assertion.

### Env/Argv State Management in singleFork Mode

- `singleFork: true` = all tests run in same process. `process.argv` and `process.env` are global state.
- Save/restore `process.argv` and `process.env` in `beforeEach`/`afterEach` to prevent cross-test contamination.
- Use `delete process.env[key]` (with `eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-dynamic-delete`) to simulate absent env vars.

### Result

- 12 tests, all pass, 46ms runtime
- Covers: happy path (flat + wrapped envelope), GET+POST body verification, exit 2 (field not found), exit 1 (GET 401, POST 500, GET network, POST network, missing --property-id, missing --code, missing HOSTFULLY_API_KEY)

## [2026-05-13] code-rotation archetype seed (T5)

### Key Findings

- `sifely-client.ts update-passcode` does NOT support changing code digits — only name/dates can be updated via `--passcode-id`. The TTLock `keyboardPwd/change` API endpoint is called but without a `keyboardPwd` field.
- vlre-hub engine strategy is CREATE new → DELETE old (not update-in-place). Instruction mirrors this: delete existing passcode, then create new one with same name and new code.
- Flag name for update/delete in sifely-client: `--passcode-id` (NOT `--keyboard-pwd-id` — inherited wisdom was wrong)
- `generate-code.ts` outputs `{"code":"...","pattern":"...","length":...,"description":"..."}`
- Archetype constants are defined inline in seed.ts (not imported from prompts/ dir) for non-guest-messaging employees. Only GUEST_MESSAGING_SYSTEM_PROMPT is imported from prompts/.
- Seed pattern: `// NO tenant_id — immutable` in update block (no tenant_id) — matches existing vlreGuestMessaging pattern exactly
- All 4 lock tools verified: `--property-id`/`--code` for update-door-code, `--property-id` for hostfully-door-code, `--exclude-codes` for generate-code, `--passcode-id` for sifely-client mutations

### Archetype Config

- ID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000016`
- role_name: `code-rotation`, model: `minimax/minimax-m2.7`, deliverable_type: `lock_code_rotation`
- risk_model: `{ approval_required: false, timeout_hours: 2 }`
- concurrency_limit: 1, notification_channel: C0960S2Q8RL
- Committed at: 4254848

## [2026-05-13] AGENTS.md + README.md documentation (T6)

### Documentation Placement

- Lock tools section: `generate-code.ts` and `update-door-code.ts` added after `sifely-client.ts delete-passcode` line (lines 74-75)
- Code-Rotation Testing section: inserted between Hostfully Testing section and the Owner's Airbnb guest test account block
- Code-Rotation Employee section: inserted between Guest-Messaging Employee section and Admin API section
- README.md Active employees table: added Code-Rotation row after Guest-Messaging row

### Format Conventions Observed

- Employee sections use bullet list for metadata (Archetype ID, Tenant, role_name, model, approval_required, notification_channel, concurrency_limit, Trigger)
- Testing sections use a resource table + bold safety warning + trigger curl block
- README Active employees table uses `**Employee (Tenant)**` bold format in first column

## [2026-05-13] Task 8 — E2E Full Lifecycle Validation

### Bug Found: Archetype Wrong Tenant ID

- Archetype `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000016` had `tenant_id = Snobahn (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004)` instead of VLRE
- Root cause: upsert update block had "// NO tenant_id — immutable" pattern — worked for archetypes that were never wrongly assigned, but this one was seeded with wrong tenant first
- Fix: DB direct update + added explicit `tenant_id` to seed.ts update block with explanation comment
- Symptom: `GET /employees/code-rotation/trigger` returned 404 NOT_FOUND

### E2E Lifecycle Infrastructure: PASS

- Admin API trigger → 202 with task_id ✅
- Lifecycle transitions: Received → Triaging → AwaitingInput → Ready → Executing → [Fly.io worker] → Submitting → Done ✅
- Duration: ~75 seconds (Fly.io cold start + worker runtime + lifecycle overhead) ✅
- `approval_required: false` shortcircuit confirmed: Submitting → Done (no approval gate) ✅
- Inngest run: `01KRHKP60EVB8XJEKM727HE4T5`, Duration 1m 15s ✅

### Blockers for Full Application-Level Pass

1. **Sifely credentials missing** — `sifely_username` and `sifely_password` not in VLRE tenant_secrets
   - Worker fails at Step 3b (sifely-client.ts list-passcodes) with "SIFELY_USERNAME required"
   - Fix: `curl -X PUT .../secrets/sifely_username -d '{"value":"<creds>"}'`
2. **Slack bot not in channel** — VLRE Papi chulo bot was removed from C0960S2Q8RL yesterday
   - Step 5 (post Slack notification) would fail with `not_in_channel`
   - Fix: Re-add bot to channel in Slack workspace settings

### Fly.io Logs: Not Available in Real-Time

- `fly logs` only shows logs still in Fly's buffer (~20-30 min retention)
- Current task logs were beyond the buffer or from recycled machine
- Previous task logs (01:14 UTC) showed: model wrote minimal summary.txt, harness ECONNREFUSED on Inngest (hybrid mode — tries to call localhost:8288 from Fly machine, fails, watchdog recovers)
- The Inngest "Failed to fire completion event — watchdog will recover" is expected and harmless in Fly hybrid mode

### property_locks table

- 46 rows for VLRE tenant
- Verified: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM property_locks WHERE tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003'; → 46`

### Evidence

- Full evidence saved: `.sisyphus/evidence/task-8-e2e-full.txt`

## [2026-05-13] F3 Blocker — Final Status

F3 (Real Manual QA) remains blocked. Checked credentials 4 times across multiple boulder continuation cycles. `sifely_username` and `sifely_password` are NOT in VLRE tenant_secrets as of this check. Plan is at 12/13. No further progress possible without user action.

Required user actions:
1. `curl -X PUT .../secrets/sifely_username -d '{"value":"<creds>"}'`
2. `curl -X PUT .../secrets/sifely_password -d '{"value":"<creds>"}'`
3. Re-add VLRE Slack bot to channel C0960S2Q8RL
