## Available Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CONTEXT7_MCP_QUERY_DOCS | Retrieves and queries up-to-date documentation and code examples from Context7 for any programming library or framework.  You must call 'resolve-library-id' first to obtain the exact Context7-compatible library ID required to use this tool, UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query.  IMPORTANT: Do not call this tool more than 3 times per question. If you cannot find what you need after 3 calls, use the best information you have. |
| CONTEXT7_MCP_RESOLVE_LIBRARY_ID | Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns matching libraries.  You MUST call this function before 'query-docs' to obtain a valid Context7-compatible library ID UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query.  Selection Process: 1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for 2. Return the most relevant match based on: - Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized) - Description relevance to the query's intent - Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts) - Source reputation (consider libraries with High or Medium reputation more authoritative) - Benchmark Score: Quality indicator (100 is the highest score)  Response Format: - Return the selected library ID in a clearly marked section - Provide a brief explanation for why this library was chosen - If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one - If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements  For ambiguous queries, request clarification before proceeding with a best-guess match.  IMPORTANT: Do not call this tool more than 3 times per question. If you cannot find what you need after 3 calls, use the best result you have. |
